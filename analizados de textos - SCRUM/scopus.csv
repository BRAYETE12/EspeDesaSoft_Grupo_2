This is the case for fine scale analysis of flow features around hydraulic structures of complex geometry, where generation of the 3D grid, application of the correct turbulence modeling approach, or modeling of the free surface all require extensive experience and knowledge. The aim of this paper is to perform a numerical hydrodynamic experiment for a hydraulic structure with complex geometry to assess the model performance, in terms of grid resolution, grid refinement methods as well as turbulence modeling. The open source modeling environment of OpenFOAM is tested and validated against laboratory measurements, moreover, practical recommendations are made for future applications of the numerical solver. © 2021, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Mailing lists can be an important source for extracting behavioral patterns in the software development. A new approach for that is the use of Neurolinguistic theory to determine what is the Preferred Representational cognitive System (PRS) of software engineers in that specific context. Different resources and cognitive channels are used by developers in order to achieve software understanding. An important question on this matter is: What types of representational systems are preferred by software engineers? This paper presents a psychometrically based neurolinguistic method to identify the PRS of software developers. Experimental evaluation of the approach was carried out in three experiments to assess the Preferred Representational System of developers at Industrial and OSS (Apache server and Postgresql) mailing lists. For the OSS projects, the results showed that the PRS scores of the top-committers clearly differ from the general population of the projects. For industry, the experiment showed that the developers indeed have a PRS. Finally, for both scenarios, the qualitative analysis also indicated that the PRS scores obtained are aligned with the developers’ profiles, considering that alignment is essential to effective communication within the team and enhances the development process due to a better software comprehension. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101877099

The importance of this subject is conspicuous when the analysis of displacement and deformations around the excavation is necessary according to the national building regulation due to the presence of buildings in this area, which are of high sensitivity to asymmetric settlement. Therefore, in addition to the stability analysis of excavation, engineers are also dealing with the assessment and prediction of deformations and displacements of its surrounding by using geotechnical site specifications, excavation geometry, surrounding overloads, and simulating the excavations stages. The analysis of displacement and deformation is highly dependent to the constitutive soil model and the use of an appropriate model that imitates the actual behavior of the soil is of significant importance in the simulation of soil behavior in numerical software. In the present study, a comparison investigated between the results obtained from hardening-soil and Mohr-Coulomb constitutive models for a case study of a 16.5m deep excavation in Tehran city with the numerical method of finite element analysis. The results show that the soil behavior and the excavation operations induced displacements are more similar to the reality if the hardening-soil constitutive model is selected compared to the Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model. © 2020 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society.

Here we design an interfacial Schottky junction of Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx resulting from the contact potential difference between Ti3C2Tx and Bi2S3. The different work functions induce the formation of a local electrophilic/nucleophilic region. The self-driven charge transfer across the interface increases the local electron density on Ti3C2Tx. The formed Schottky barrier inhibits the backflow of electrons and boosts the charge transfer and separation. The photocatalytic activity of Bi2S3/Ti3C2Tx intensively improved the amount of reactive oxygen species under 808 nm near-infrared radiation. They kill 99.86% of Staphylococcus aureus and 99.92% of Escherichia coli with the assistance of hyperthermia within 10 min.

However, the vast majority of these protocols rely on ad hoc interlacing mechanisms and safety codes which raise the heterogeneity and complexity of the overarching railway system. Therefore, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, the company who is in charge of managing the Italian railway network, coordinated the definition of the Protocollo Vitale Standard (Standard Vital Protocol). This protocol is inspired to, and compliant with, the communication protocols adopted for the European Train Control System (ETCS) (SUBSET, UNISIG, 037, Euroradio FIS, version 2.3. 0; SUBSET, UNISIG, 098, RBC-RBC safe communication interface, 2007), and it is meant to become the standard layer to enable safe communication between components of the Italian railway system. This paper reports our experience in the design, implementation, verification, and validation of the Protocollo Vitale Standard in compliance with the European safety standards for railway systems. We first defined a safety plan and a verification and validation plan, which guide the design, development, verification, and validation activities as required by safety standards. Guidelines of such plans have been followed strictly until completion of the work, which concludes with the provision of a safety case where all safety evidences are summarized. Noticeably, we (i) selected appropriate safety mechanisms, (ii) verified the software design, (iii) implemented the software in compliance with code metrics and coding rules, (iv) conducted tests to validate the protocol against its functional and performance requirements, and ultimately (v) devised all relevant documentation and a safety case which summarizes the evidences needed for certification. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101869806

Moreover, mathematical process models exist that allow optimizing the operational settings of waste management processes in order to produce an optimal bio-fertilizer quality adjusted to the local market needs. If an integrated tool would be available that couples process modelling to watershed modelling, the valorization chain could be simulated as a whole, i.e. the bio-fertilizer type and composition could be adjusted to the local watershed and environmental impacts of bio-based fertilizer production and application could more easily be assessed and controlled.

These rural roads are constructed for a design life of 10 years. But these low volume roads loose serviceability within two or three years. To find out the reasons of less sustainability, different rural road sites in coastal region were visited by the authors and sandy soil (used for Improved Subgrade) and clayey soil (borrow pit soil used for side slope and shoulder) were collected from 28 sites. Grain size analysis, liquid limit and plastic limit of collected samples were determined. Fineness Modulus (FM) of sandy soils ranged from 0.00 to 0.50 and the most borrow pit soils are lean clay. Dynamic Cone Penetration (DCP) tests were conducted on pavement and shoulder. The test results were analyzed and compared with the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) recommended DCP values for rural road by employing the AfCAP LVR-DCP software. It is found that the DCP values of base under pavement and shoulders were inadequate. Several reasons were identified which are responsible for less sustainability of rural roads. The reasons are use of unsuitable material, poor compaction, borrow pit location at toe, vehicle movement over soft shoulder, consolidation settlement due to soft soil under road embankment, inadequate design of palisading and slope protection, erosion of side slope by wave action. A new road widening methodology is proposed for making sustainable rural road in coastal areas of Bangladesh. © 2020 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society.

Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis, malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications (e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides, we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron’s average program accuracy is 96.96%, which is better than the traditional NMT model. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102030836
